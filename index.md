Blackpool is a DAO that participates in the SoRare ecosystem, running a data driven strategy to build portfolio of player cards. Blackpool will engage in auctions, in secondary market trades and in SO5 tournaments.

Blackpool intends to generate cashflows and accrue value for the DAO by:

- taking arbitrage opportunities between primary and secondary markets
- loaning out a collection of cards to other managers
- buying and selling cards based on player news
- scouting young talent and buying cards early
- competing in SO5 tournaments
