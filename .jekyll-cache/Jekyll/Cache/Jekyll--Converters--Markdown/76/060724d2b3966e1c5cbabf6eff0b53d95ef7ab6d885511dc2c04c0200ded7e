<p>Faced by serious and worsening financial conditions in the NFT world, Blackpoolâ€™s Executive Board of Directors unanimously approved a Decentralised Financial Fair Play concept for the gameâ€™s well-being in June 2020. The concept, developed and supported by the entire gaming family, recognises the need for world-wide action to restrict some of the worst excesses of the game. Its fundamental principles and objectives are:</p>

<p>â€¢ to improve the economic and financial capability of the clubs, increasing their transparency and credibility;
â€¢ to place the necessary importance on the protection of creditors and to ensure that clubs settle their liabilities with employees, social/tax authorities and other clubs punctually;
â€¢ to introduce more discipline and rationality in club football finances;
â€¢ to encourage clubs to operate on the basis of their own revenues;
â€¢ to encourage responsible spending for the long-term benefit of football;
â€¢ to protect the long-term viability and sustainability of its stakeholders.</p>

<p><strong>(Those principles are fantasy principles and so do not have legally binding character)</strong></p>
