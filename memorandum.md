# Memorandum

BlackPool aims to become a leader in providing financial derivatives in digital sports marketplaces such as asset valuation index, leasing, insurance mechanism and more, starting with SoRare, the leading blockchain footfall fantasy game.

Blackpool will be adopting a diversified strategy in order to maximise returns of its shareholders while benefiting the whole SoRare ecosystem. This will range from scouting new gems to investing in star players, managers or being extremely active in the transfer market.

This strategy could be affiliated to the one Chelsea FC is currently pursuing, in which Roman Abramovich invested more than 1 billion pounds and bought an important number of players in order to loan them. That strategy is proving to be one of the most successful strategies from a business return point of view. The loan system is a win-win-win. It works for the loanees, for the parent club and for the recipient club. It is a perfect deal for all parties.

Indeed, in fantasy games, the best NFT cards are the scarcest ones on the market. You either have to pay a high price to get them, or win them as rewards, which often requires already having great players in your team. As such, the average value spent by users on Sorare is high (several $ETH) and the top 25 users approximately own half of the current global cards market cap ($1M) according to SorareData.com

Strong advocate of decentralisation, Blackpool will also thrive in providing managers the tools necessary to strengthen their understanding of the market by offering data driven strategies to maximise profit or even arbitrage opportunities.

Loans, lotteries and other exotic trading strategies and solutions proposed by Blackpool will benefit the ecosystem by allowing every manager to have the tool they need to compete on a more level playing field by being able to align scarce (and more performant) players and compete for rewards. This would in turn increase supply distribution and foster user growth.

Composed of people from all backgrounds, we believe that approach should reflect the spectrum of skills Blackpool has to offer. Therefore, Blackpool’s implementation of its strategy will be based on rigorous data analytics done via machine learning combined with years of expertise in the football world.  Blackpool will therefore be able to track data such as live news feed from prominent sports journalists, injuries, contract extensions, or other market rumours and act accordingly.

While Blackpool’s strategy is clearly to be a dominant figure into the transfer market, our decision-making will always be done in respect of regulations. BlackPool’s vision is to provide value to SoRare and so will not play against any potential Decentralised Financial Fair Play Regulations (DFFPR). BlackPool’s core values are still: improve the economic and financial capabilities of SoRare fantasy football managers.
